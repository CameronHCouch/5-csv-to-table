# My notes:
https://javascript.info/file was an incredible resource for using vanilla JS's filesystem capabilities. 

Added a second CSV file to test clearing of table data upon upload of a new file.

# challenge[5] CSV to table

http://codecorgi.co/challenge/5/csv-to-table

Code for the challenge[5] on the code corgi platform

Request a CSV file and add its data to the table

The CSV file `data/customers.csv` will return customer information in this
order:

ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, Job Title, City

For every row in the CSV and column add that data to the table.
